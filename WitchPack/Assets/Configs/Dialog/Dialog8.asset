      of Baalat Yarden. It\u2019s good to see you haven\u2019t lost your edge Lila."

    _speaker: {fileID: 0}
    _dialogText: "Thank you Toor, though I must admit I\u2019m a little surprised
      to see you all here. It\u2019s not every day that shamans cross paths - and
      it\u2019s even more unheard of to see so many of us at the same place."

    _speaker: {fileID: 0}
    _dialogText: "On the contrary. The Utukku here are unrelenting and their numbers
      are great. Without some help, both the shrine and I would have probably fallen
      at some point. They are probably going to send more soon - I don\u2019t believe
      that we are safe just yet."

    _dialogText: "Well, it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re here then. Nana, you should
      head back to your tribe - it isn\u2019t safe here."

    _dialogText: Just as Toor finishes speaking, the Utukku emerge from the woods,
      moving towards the shrine and the shamans.

    _dialogText: "Well, it seems leaving is no longer safe either. Nana, hide in
      the ruins of the shrine - we\u2019ll protect you."
