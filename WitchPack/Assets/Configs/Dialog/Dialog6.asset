    _dialogText: Feels odd to see us all cooperating together. We usually work alone.
  - _isNarrationDialog: 0
    _speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 9cb4b45252770504fb9368ce2229801a, type: 2}
    _dialogText: Usually we can handle things ourselves. This is different. The numbers
      of the Utukku are great. I might be a loner, but I'm not so vain to think I
      can fight them off on my own.

    _dialogText: I never really took you for a loner. Many shamans tend to live pretty
      solitary lives, only showing up when the tribe needs their help.

    _speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: ec8221a6379e2f249b54e376bfd80695, type: 2}
    _dialogText: "That\u2019s not very convincing coming from you Javan."

    _dialogText: Haha, well, I'm a special case. The job of a shaman and of a merchant
      are definitely at odds sometimes.
  - _isNarrationDialog: 0
    _speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 9cb4b45252770504fb9368ce2229801a, type: 2}
    _dialogText: Then how can you act as a merchant, when it goes against your role
      as a shaman?
  - _isNarrationDialog: 0
    _speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 64081db4c3ccc064287c4d85bb33b92d, type: 2}
    _dialogText: 'Because the role of a shaman is to care for their tribe. If it
      needs a trader - what kind of shaman am I, if I refuse to take on that burden?
      We all make sacrifices, in our own way. '
  - _isNarrationDialog: 0
    _speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 9cb4b45252770504fb9368ce2229801a, type: 2}
    _dialogText: Except your sacrifice comes with many benefits.

    _speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 64081db4c3ccc064287c4d85bb33b92d, type: 2}
    _dialogText: Yes. But wealth and influence bring with them a whole lot of responsibilities
      and issues. I may have a lot of power in our tribe - but I'm not as free as
      either of you. Is that not a benefit of your solitary way of life?
