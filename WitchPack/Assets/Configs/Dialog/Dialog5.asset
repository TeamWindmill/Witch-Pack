    _dialogText: I'm good. Though to be honest, lately I've been having some issues
      with some supply lines.

    _dialogText: "I see age hasn\u2019t made you any less sharp. Yes, merchants coming
      from across the Yarden River are being attacked. \nI\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve
      already met the Utukku yourself?"

    _dialogText: "That\u2019s how the survivors call them. These corrupted creatures
      seem to target any person they come across, but it\u2019s not clear what they
      are after."

    _dialogText: "We ran into them and fought. They tried attacking the Core at Mount
      Turan for some reason, but we\u2019re not sure what they are after. Would you
      happen to know?"

    _dialogText: "Well\u2026 usually, you'd be right, but these things have been
      hurting my- I mean the tribe\u2019s profits and prosperity, so I'm interested
      in stopping them as well."

    _dialogText: "Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have much information about them, but
      I do know their numbers grow the more you move towards the east. What you\u2019ve
      encountered were probably just some scouts."

    _dialogText: Not necessarily. Javan, will you help us look into this? I know
      you are needed here, but we need all the help we can get.

    _speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 64081db4c3ccc064287c4d85bb33b92d, type: 2}
    _dialogText: Of course. I have a duty of protecting and helping our tribe as
      much as any other shaman.

      you?"

    _dialogText: Regardless, we should move east. The more Utukku we encounter, the
      more likely we are to find information about them.
